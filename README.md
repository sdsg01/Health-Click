HealthClick is a telemedicine app which can be employed by hospitals to improve patient comfort and experience. In this pandemic, the necessity of remote healthcare has been acutely felt in our society.

Made using Flask, DialogFlow and Bootstrap.

### General Info:

##### Made for IEEE SheHacks Hackathon by GHRCE Chapter 
&nbsp;
 
> HealthCareBusinessTech report states that patients desire the following three  functionalities in their apps the most: 
> access to previous medical records
> ability to make appointments without calling
> processing refills for medical prescriptions
> Yet, only 11% of healthcare apps associated with hospitals have these features. A > translation feature is also available to improve accessibility.  
> We wish to not only overcome these shortcomings but also set a benchmark by adding > more functionalities/features such as:

1. Medicine delivery for patients.
2. Option to set reminders for timely ingestion of medicines.
3. Automate delivery of medicines which are prescribed monthly (i.e are to be consumed in a routine)
4. Scheduling/Cancelling appointments with the hospital via the app.
5. An FAQ chatbot for answering all your queries including covid details as well.
6. Booking at-home lab tests with the hospital via the app.
7. Browsing through health insurance plans and options.
